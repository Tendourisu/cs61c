<ul>
<li>Online exams will use group Zoom proctoring. Students will receive a Zoom link in the days leading up to the exam.
<ul>
<li>Each room will have a proctor and several students.</li>
<li>If you want to know who your proctor is, please reach out to course staff.</li>
<li>Everyone will be muted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you'd prefer to have a recorded Zoom room without other students, please let us know on the alterations form.</li>
<li>If you feel uncomfortable with proctoring, please reach out so you can discuss alternatives with an instructor.</li>
<li>Dry run logistics will be announced on Piazza the morning of Wednesday, March 2nd.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="before-the-exam">Before the Exam</h3>
<p>Download Zoom on your smartphone and experiment with a video recording setup (see below). <a href="https://fa21.cs161.org/sample-setups.html">You can see examples of setups from course staff here</a>. Please reach out privately on Piazza if you are having setup difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-day-of-the-exam-1">On the Day of the Exam</h3>

<h3 id="technical-issues">Technical Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't worry if your video feed disconnects briefly during the exam.</li>
<li>If you encounter significant technical problems, don't worry about video proctoring and focus on finishing the exam.</li>
<li>We may ask some students to take a short verbal exam after the exam and explain how to solve one or more problems that are similar to an exam question they got right.</li>
<li>If you encounter Internet problems, write your answers locally and send them to <a href="https://cs61c.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2d4e5e1b1c4e6d4f485f464841485403484958">[email&#160;protected]</a> as soon as the exam is over.</li>
